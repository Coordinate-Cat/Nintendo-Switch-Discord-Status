# Switch Rich Presence
A gimped, mildly decent solution to display what you're playing on Nintendo Switch on Discord. Thanks to [Da532](https://github.com/Da532) for doing pretty much 99% of the work on this one. ✌️

## Introduction
Switch Rich Presence is a fork of ['NS-RPC' (Nintendo Switch Rich Presence)](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC) and is an Electron app for Windows and macOS that allows Switch users to display
the game they're currently playing as their Discord status with Rich Presence.

*This was my first time ever using JavaScript. I'm bad at it. Fight me.*

### With Switch Rich Presence you can..
* Show off to peasants that you have a Switch across all of Discord.
* Select from a limited-by-discord list of games to show off.
* Set a custom status message to let everyone know exactly what you're doing.
* Experience my absolutely disgusting user interface.

## Prerequisites
All you need is a high tolerance for bad UI and the [Discord App](https://discordapp.com) installed to the same machine.

## Installing
If you're looking for convenience, you'll find already built copies of Switch Rich Presence for
both Windows and macOS [here](https://github.com/hobby-grade/Switch-Rich-Presence/releases).

### From source

Running from the source *for whatever reason* is also possible. Simply install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions below.

Once installed, git clone or download and extract the source to a folder you're
comfortable working in. Open a terminal or command prompt and locate to the
current directory using `cd path/to/directory`.

You'll next need to install the required dependencies. This is simple and can be
done by simply typing into your terminal `npm .` which will grab all the needed
information from the package.json file.

Finally, to execute the application you simply need to enter into terminal `npm start`.

## Anything else?
Not as of yet. If you have feature suggestions or need support, head over to this handy [Discord server](https://discord.gg/StDcdMu) and talk to us.

Have a good one!
