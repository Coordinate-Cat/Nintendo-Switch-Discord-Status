# Switch Rich Presence
A gimped, mildly decent solution to display what you're playing on Nintendo Switch on Discord. Thanks to [Da532](https://github.com/Da532) for doing pretty much 99% of the work on this one. ✌️

## Introduction
Switch Rich Presence is a barely competent fork of ['NS-RPC' (Nintendo Switch Rich Presence)](https://github.com/Da532/NS-RPC), an Electron app for Windows and macOS that allows Switch users to display
the game they're currently playing as their Discord status with Rich Presence.

*This was my first time ever using JavaScript. I'm bad at it.*

### With Switch Rich Presence you can...
* Show off to peasants that you have a Switch across all of Discord.
* Select from a limited-by-discord list of games to show off.
* Set a custom status message to let everyone know exactly what you're doing.
* Experience my absolutely disgusting user interface.

### Missing a game?
Open an issue on this page and I'll add it as quickly as I can.

### Problems:
As of right now, I do not know of a way to have more than 150 art assets stored by Discord in order to display artwork for all of the games. I have not added 150 games to the list yet, but I will attempt to find a way around this limitation in the meantime.
I am also attempting to correct the UI errors.

## Prerequisites
All you need is a high tolerance for bad UI and the [Discord App](https://discordapp.com) installed to the same machine.

## Installing
If you're looking for convenience, you'll find already built copies of Switch Rich Presence for
both Windows [here](https://github.com/hobby-grade/Switch-Rich-Presence/releases).

## Building From source
Building from source is also possible.

Required packages: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Once Node.js is installed, git clone or download and extract the source files to your chosen directory.
2. Open a terminal window, or command prompt in that directory.
3. To install the application's required dependencies, use the command `npm install`.
4. Finally, to execute the application you simply need to enter into terminal `npm start`.
